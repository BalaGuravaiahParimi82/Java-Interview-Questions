# Java-Interview-Questions
This Repo Contains Java Interview Questions

**Question 1: What are the 4 pillars of OOPS?**
4 pillars of OOPS are:
 1. Abstraction
 2. Encapsulation
 3. Inheritance
 4. Polymorphism
 Let’s take a look at them:
**1. Abstraction**: Abstraction is a process of hiding the
implementation details and showing only functionality to the
user.
Real world examples:- TV remote: To start the TV, you have to press the power
bu on, you don’t have to know about the internal circuit
opera ons like how infrared waves are passing.- Car gears: We know what happens when we change the
gear. But we don’t know how changing gear works under
the hood, that informa on is irrelevant to us, so it is
abstracted.
In java, Abstraction can be achieved in two ways:- Abstract
classes- Interfaces
2. Encapsulation : Encapsulation on is a process of Binding data and
 methods within a class . Think of it like showing the essential
 details of a class by using the access control modifiers (public,
 private, protected ). So, we can say that Encapsulation leads
 to the desired level of Abstraction.
 Example:
Java Bean, where all data members are made private and you
 define certain public methods to the outside world to access
 them.
 3. Inheritance : Using inheritance means defining a parent-child
 relationship between classes, by doing so, you can reuse the
 code that is already defined in the parent class. Code
 reusability is the biggest advantage of Inheritance.
 Java does not allow mul ple inheritance through classes but it
 allows it through interfaces.
 4. Polymorphism : Poly means many and Morph means forms.
 Polymorphism is the process in which an object or func on
 takes different forms.
There are 2 types of Polymorphism :-
Compile Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)-
Run Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
 In Method overloading, two or more methods in one class have
 the same method name but different arguments. It is called as Compile
 me polymorphism because it is decided at compile me which
 overloaded method will be called.      
Overriding means when we have two methods with same name and
 same parameters in parent and child class. Through overriding, child
 class can provide specific implementa on for the method which is
 already defined in the parent class.
