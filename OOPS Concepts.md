>
> Answer: 4 pillars of OOPS are:
>
> 1\. Abstracon\
> 2. Encapsulaon\
> 3. Inheritance\
> 4. Polymorphism
>
> Let's take a look at them:
>
> 1\. **Abstracon** : Abstracon is a process of hiding the\
> implementaon details and showing only funconality to the user.
>
> Real world examples:
>
> **-** TV remote: To start the TV, you have to press the power buon,
> you don't have to know about the internal circuit operaons like how
> infrared waves are passing.
>
> **-** Car gears: We know what happens when we change the gear. But we
> don't know how changing gear works under the hood, that informaon is
> irrelevant to us, so it is abstracted.
>
> In java, Abstracon can be achieved in two ways:
>
> **-** Abstract\
> classes
>
> **-** Interfaces
>
> 2\. **Encapsulaon** : Encapsulaon is a process of *Binding data and
> methods within a class* . Think of it like showing the essenal details
> of a class by using the access control modifiers (*public, private,
> protected* ). So, we can say that Encapsulaon leads to the desired
> level of Abstracon.
>
> Example:
>
> Java Bean, where all data members are made private and you define
> certain public methods to the outside world to access them.
>
> 3\. **Inheritance** : Using inheritance means defining a parent-child
> relaonship between classes, by doing so, you can reuse the code that
> is already defined in the parent class. Code\
> reusability is the biggest advantage of Inheritance.
>
> Java does not allow mulple inheritance through classes but it allows
> it through interfaces.
>
> 4\. **Polymorphism** : Poly means many and Morph means forms.
> Polymorphism is the process in which an object or funcon takes
> different forms. There are 2 types of Polymorphism :
>
> **-** Compile Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
>
> **-** Run Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
>
> In Method overloading, two or more methods in one class have the same
> method name but different arguments. It is called as *Compile me
> polymorphism* because it is decided at compile me which overloaded
> method will be called.
>
> Overriding means when we have two methods with same name and same
> parameters in parent and child class. Through overriding, child class
> can provide specific implementaon for the method which is already
> defined in the parent class.
